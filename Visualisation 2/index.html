    <h1>Education in Australia</h1>
  </header>
    <div class="page">
      <p>This visualisation provides a comprehensive overview of key educational metrics across 
        <b>Australia</b>, including student attendance, student-teacher ratios, international student 
        demographics, and school funding from 2009 to 2023. By examining these aspects, we gain insights 
        into the allocation of resources, regional differences in educational engagement, and the evolving
         presence of international students. These metrics highlight how <b>Australia's</b> educational landscape
          adapts to meet both domestic needs and global interests.</p>

          <h2>Student-Teacher Ratios by State (2023)</h2>
          <p>This map illustrates student-teacher ratios across Australian states and territories in 2023.
             <b>Western Australia</b> and <b>New South Wales</b> show higher ratios, indicating more students per 
             teacher, while <b>Victoria</b> has one of the lower ratios, suggesting more individualized 
             attention for students. These regional variations reflect differing resource allocations 
             in education.</p>

          <h2>Growth of International Students by State or Territory and Year (2002-2021)</h2>
          <p>International student growth showed strong positive trends until <b>2020</b>, when the growth 
            rate dropped. This decline reflects the impact of events such as the global pandemic on student mobility and enrollment.
            <br>
            The highest growth was <b>1900%</b> in <b>2010</b>, by Kuwait. Furthermore, the largest groups of international students are from <b>China</b> and <b>India</b>. These nationalities contribute 
            significantly to the international student body in Australia, influencing both educational 
            policies and cultural diversity on campuses.</p>

          <p>This visualisation presents trends in total school income and income per student across 
            Australian states from 2009 to 2022. Over this period, <b>New South Wales</b> and <b>Victoria</b> consistently 
            lead in total income, while <b>Northern Territory</b> recorded the highest income per student in <b>2022</b>, 
            at <b>$26,453</b>. The steady increase in income per student across most states reflects ongoing investments 
            in educational resources, varying by state to address regional needs.</p>

          <h2>Student Attendance by State/Territory and Year (2014-2023)</h2>
          <p>This visualisation highlights trends in student attendance rates across Australian states 
            and territories from 2014 to 2023. The school attendance data for the year 2020 has <b>not</b> been 
            published. This is due to inconsistencies caused by varying health guidelines and changes in 
            schooling arrangements across Australia in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
            <br><br>
            Attendance rates are an essential indicator of student 
            engagement and can reflect a range of regional factors. <b>New South Wales</b> and <b>Victoria</b> consistently record some of 
            the highest attendance rates, averaging around <b>93%</b> in the earlier years, while <b>Northern 
            Territory</b> shows lower rates, with a rate of <b>76%</b> in 2022.
          <br>
          <br>
          The trends over time reveal how different states and territories approach attendance initiatives and 
          highlight potential areas for targeted support. While attendance rates in regions like <b>Queensland</b> and
           <b>Western Australia</b> remain stable, modest fluctuations suggest the impact of various factors. These findings 
            emphasize the need for localized strategies to boost student engagement, especially in areas facing 
            persistent attendance challenges, ensuring that all students benefit from consistent educational 
            opportunities nationwide.
          </p>

    </div>

    <p>The data reveals regional disparities in both funding and attendance, with states like New South 
      Wales and Victoria showing high attendance rates and substantial funding allocations. 
      International student growth remains concentrated in a few states, driven by countries like 
      China and India. Meanwhile, variations in student-teacher ratios and income per student suggest
       differing priorities and capacities across regions. Together, these insights underscore the 
       importance of ongoing investment and targeted strategies to support equitable and effective
        education throughout <b>Australia</b>.</p>
